### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! 
With a Master's degree in Language Technology specializing in NLP, I just started my professional career. 
Curious about languages, AI and different cultures.
I'm motivated to keep learning in order to apply my skills in the IT and linguistic fields. 

As part of my Master's degree, I was working on a research project. Its aim was to develop machine translation from Alsatian dialects into standard German, by linking them to two Germanic languages. Multilingual models were used, as well as an LLM. 

Currently, I'm employed by the UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ© as a NLP Engineer. I'm contributing to the research project MaTOS.
